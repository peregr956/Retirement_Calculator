# Retirement Projection Simulator

This is a customizable retirement projection tool built with Python and Streamlit. It allows users to model the growth of multiple retirement accounts—such as TSP, 401(k), and IRAs—over time and view results in both future and inflation-adjusted (today's) dollars.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Models multiple retirement account types:
  - TSP / 401(k) (with employer match)
  - Traditional or Roth IRA
- 🕰️ Projects account balances from current age to retirement and beyond
- 💵 Displays both **nominal** and **real (inflation-adjusted)** values
- 🧠 Simple logic for compound growth and contribution modeling
- 🔧 Streamlit UI for easy input and visualization

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python (3.8+)
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retirement-simulator.git
cd retirement-simulator
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## 📈 Example Use Case

A user aged 35 contributes \$22,500/year to their TSP with a 7% return and 2% inflation. The simulator shows both the projected account balance at age 65 and the equivalent in today's dollars.

## 📝 Future Roadmap

* Add withdrawal phase modeling (drawdown during retirement)
* Introduce tax treatment and prioritization rules
* Support real estate or rental income streams
* Add Monte Carlo simulation for variability
* Scenario comparison view (e.g. retire at 60 vs. 65)
